# Task 1 – Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset by analyzing its structure, data types, and overall suitability for machine learning. The task involves basic data exploration without building any ML model.

##

# Tools Used

Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

# Dataset

Titanic Dataset (titanic.csv)


# Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Viewed the first and last few records to understand the structure.

Identified numerical, categorical, binary, and ordinal features.

Checked unique values in categorical columns to understand data distribution.

Identified the target variable and input features for machine learning.

Analyzed dataset size and its suitability for ML tasks.

Observed data quality issues such as missing values and class imbalance.
